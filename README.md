# Audit-Management-System

To automate audit lifecycle activities in order to simplify the process. To identify errors in management activities and suggest possible changes and to guide the management to manage the operations most effectively and productively.

# Methodology
We have incorporated scrum which is an agile software development methodology.
Scrum is an adaptable, fast, flexible and effective agile framework that is designed to deliver value to the customer throughout the development of the project.
The development starts from a general idea of what needs to be built, elaborating a list of characteristics ordered by priority (product backlog) that the owner of the product wants to obtain.
We ensured regular scrum meetings in order to plan out daily objectives and to track down project
